    <h2  class="head it">What is CSS</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><span id="cross" class="bold">Css is not necessary</span> <span class="y_bg bold">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li class="it" style="text-decoration:underline ;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="head it">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="letter-spacing:7.2px ;">Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li id="li_2">Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li class="li_space" >External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li class="li_space" >The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="y_bg bold">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles ,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it for yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element, ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
